//Basic string algorithm - find the first repeating character 

// P - a string 
// R - a string 
// E - 'stress', the function should return 't',
// P

// task - return the first letter that doesn't repeat

// upper and lowercase letters are the same 
    // loop through string
    //if the first letter repeates, go to next
    //repeat until you find a letter that does not repeat 
    //how do you check if a letter repeats ? 

    //if you have to loop through each character Big O is o(n^2)


    //How to solve efficently? 
        //use a hasmap 
        //character will be the key and # of times it appears is frequency 

function firstNonRepeatingLetter(s) {

    for(let i = 0; i<s.length; i++) {
        
    }

    
  }

  console.log(firstNonRepeatingLetter("stress"))
